# Hey there! Iâ€™m Pratyush ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a passionate tech enthusiast deeply immersed in the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing an Integrated MTech in Computer Science and Engineering at VIT, where Iâ€™m continuously exploring and learning about the cutting-edge advancements in technology and data science.

## A Bit About Me

It's not been very long that I've been captivated by the potential of technology to transform the world. This fascination led me to dive into programming and data science, where Iâ€™ve been able to merge my interests with hands-on projects and research. My journey has been one of continuous learning, driven by a desire to understand how data can provide valuable insights and solve complex problems.

Currently pursuing my Integrated MTech in Computer Science and Engineering, which has provided me with a strong foundation in various aspects of technology. My coursework and projects have covered a broad spectrum, including data analysis, machine learning and Deep lEarning. This academic experience has been complemented by practical, real-world applications and collaborations that have further enriched my understanding.

## Skills & Expertise

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Javascript, R, SQL
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git/GitHub, PowerBI, MS Excel, MongoDB, Linux/Unix

## Projects & Achievements

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on several exciting projects that have allowed me to apply my skills in innovative ways. For example:

- **FaceEx:**  Facial Emotion Detection â€” pandas, numpy, keras, sklearn, opencv

  Elevated model validation accuracy by over 30% from an initial of 52.15% to 84.06% validation accuracy, utilizing cutting-edge techniques like Batch Normalization and Dropout to maximize model generalization and performance.
  
- **SusAct:**  Federated Learning Approach to Suspicious Activity Detection â€” numpy, tensorflow, tensorflow-federated, os

  Achieved a 0.81 Sparse Categorical Accuracy, training across 30 federated clients to simulate real-world non-iid data and the maintaining the heterogeneity in 
  the data distribution by utilizing the federated learning approach. The project focuses on how federated learning can be used to reduce the communication 
  cost. Ongoing reserach on event driven federated learning systems aims to optimize the communicatin costs even further as the model updates are shared only 
  when a certain defined trigerring event is detected.
  
  
- **BrnTmr:**  Federated Learning Approach to Brain Tumor Detection and Recognition â€” numpy, pytorch, flwr, os

  Implementing a Federated Learning framework for brain tumor detection and recognition, simulating a
  decentralized setup with 5 participating clients to enhance model efficiency, improve generalization, and reduce
  communication costs.

## Interests & Goals

Iâ€™m deeply interested in the evolving fields of machine learning and data science. My goal is to leverage my skills to contribute to impactful projects and innovations. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies, and I thrive on collaboration with others who share a similar passion.
